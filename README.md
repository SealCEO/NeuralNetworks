# NeuralNetworks
This project was an exploration of Neural Networks. It was done with Cameron Bronson, but I did all of the coding. He helped me analyze the results, create the report, create a powerpoint that went along with it, and ran my code on his computers. The CSVs for this project are too big to directly put, but I have linked the Kaggle datatsets.
